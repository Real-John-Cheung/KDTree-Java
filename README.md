# KDTree-Java
A Java implementation of KDTree. This implementation is designed to handle arbitary customed objects, your object's class must have a nullary constructor, see [example](https://github.com/Real-John-Cheung/KDTree-Java/blob/master/kdtree/example/KDTreeExample/KDTreeExample.pde) for details.

A `jar` library file is in the `./kdtree` folder. If you want to use it with processing, put the entire `./kdtree` folder in your processing `libraries` folder
